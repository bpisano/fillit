# fillit
Here is the complete fillit project. It is designed to pass all the [42FileChecker](https://github.com/jgigault/42FileChecker) unit test.

# How does it works ?
Fillit is designed to takes one file in parameter containing from 0 to 26 [tetriminos](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/TÃ©tromino). The file should only contain "#", "." and "\n" characters.
Fillit will first verify the input (called **Verification** step), build a model that will be used for the solving algorithm (called **Build** step), adjust the tetriminos (called **Adjustment** step), build the smallest map (called **Map builder** step), then find the smaller square the tetriminos can fits in (called the **Solve** step).

# Steps
## Read
Simply call `char *read_file(char *file_name);` to read the content in **file_name**.

## Verify
Fillit will first verify that the input is correct by checking :

 1. if the input contain at least 20 characters
 2. if the input contain only `#`, `.` and `\n`
 3. if there is exactly one `\n` between 2 tetriminos model

This step calls `int input_is_valid(char *str);` to determine if the input is in the correct format.

## Build
This step is used to convert the input to a **t_tetri** structure that contains a 2D array of characters that represent a tetrimino and a *x*, *y*, *width* and *height* property.
A **t_tetri** is declared as the following :

    typedef struct	s_tetri
    {
    	char		**tetri;
    	int		width;
    	int		height;
    }			t_tetri;

This step calls `t_tetri **build_model(char *str);` to build a list of **t_tetri**. It takes in argument the content of the file read by `read_file`.

## Adjustment
This step setup the *width* and *height* property of each tetrimino. It also center it up left.
This step calls `void adjust(t_tetri **model);` to adjust the model.

## Map Builder
This step will create a **t_map** structure witch contain a `char **map` property who represents the smallest calculated map the tetrinminos should fits in.
A **t_map** structure contains a `t_list *todo` property who represent the list of tetriminos who have to be placed on the map.
A **t_map** also contain a `int size` property that represent the size of the map. The size is modified every time the size of *map* is modified.
A **t_map** is declared as the following :

    typedef struct	s_map
    {
    	char		**map;
    	int		size;
    	t_list		*todo;
    }			t_map;

This step calls `t_map *build_map(t_list **models);` to build the smallest map the tetriminos should fits in.

## Solve
This step will try to fit all the tetriminos in the smallest calculated map. If it failed, it will raise the size of the map by 1.
This step calls `void solve(t_map *map);` to solve and print the smallest square the tetriminos can fits in.
